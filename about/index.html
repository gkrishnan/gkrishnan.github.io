I’m Gopi Krishnan Nambiar, an engineer interested in Machine Learning and Distributed Systems.

I work at Salesforce’s Big Data team and help build the applog ingestion and processing pipeline. Earlier, I worked for Intuit Bangalore on a text application platform - txtWeb.

I completed my Masters in CS (ML+Big Data) at Georgia Tech, during which I TA’ed the course Data and Visual Analytics under Prof. Polo Chau. I also dabbled with fraud detection models during my summer internship with the Security Analytics team at Salesforce.
