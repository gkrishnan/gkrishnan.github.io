I’m Gopi Krishnan Nambiar, a software engineer interested in Machine Learning and Distributed Systems.

I work at Salesforce’s Einstein.ai team and help build deep learning systems. Earlier, I worked on high volume Data Ingestion pipelines on the Salesforce Big Data team and also at Intuit Bangalore on a text application platform - txtWeb.

I completed my Masters in CS (Machine Learning) at Georgia Tech, during which I was the head TA for the course Data and Visual Analytics under Prof. Polo Chau. I also dabbled with fraud detection models during my summer internship with the Security Analytics team at Salesforce.
