I’m Gopi Krishnan Nambiar, a software engineer interested in Machine Learning and Distributed Systems.

I work for Meta as an ML Engineer in the Stories Ranking team, with a focus on Notifications, Stories and Messaging experiences. Earlier I used to work for Salesforce’s Einstein.ai group building Deep Learning systems and have also dabbled with high volume data ingestion pipelines. 

I completed my Masters in Computer Science (Machine Learning) at Georgia Tech, where I was the head TA for Data and Visual Analytics (CSE 6242) under Prof. Polo Chau and Graduate Research Assistant at the Tenenbaum Institute working on a UAV simulator application under Prof. Doug Bodner.
