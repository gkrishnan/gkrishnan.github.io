Hello!

I'm Gopi Krishnan Nambiar, an engineer interested in Machine Learning and Distributed Systems.

I work for Meta as a Machine Learning Engineer in the Stories Ranking team, with a focus on Notifications, Stories and Messaging experiences. Earlier I used to work for Salesforceâ€™s Einstein.ai group building Deep Learning systems and have also dabbled with high volume data ingestion pipelines. I completed my Masters in Computer Science (Machine Learning) at Georgia Tech, where I was the head TA for Data and Visual Analytics (CSE 6242) under Prof. Polo Chau, Graduate Research Assistant at the Tenenbaum Institute working on an ed-tech UAV simulator application advised by Prof. Doug Bodner and worked on 3D modeling simulations advised by Prof. Ling Liu.
