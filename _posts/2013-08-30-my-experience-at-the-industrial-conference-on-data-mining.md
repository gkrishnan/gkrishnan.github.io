The Industrial Conference on Data Mining ([ICDM](http://www.data-mining-forum.de/)) is a prestigious conference (rated as one of the [top 25](http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Conference/1194/icdm-industrial-conference-on-data-mining) data mining conferences in the world), where top researchers present theoretical and application oriented topics on Data Mining. This edition of the conference was held from July 16-21 at Newark, New Jersey. This was perceived as a unique opportunity by the team to present the work we had been doing in the space of data mining, since this conference was a perfect collaboration between academia (Harvard, Oxford, MIT ) and industry labs (Yahoo Labs, HP Labs, CERN to name a few who had published their work at this conference earlier).

Samit Paul from the Data Services team and myself, from the txtWeb team submitted a research paper on the work we had been doing over IntelliTips to the above mentioned conference, and the conference organizers accepted the submission as an Industry Paper! We were thrilled with this outcome and prepared the posters and material needed for the conference.

The conference session was declared open by [Prof Petra Perner](http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Author/221248/petra-perner), Chair of the ICDM and a well renowned researcher from the University of Leipzig. The first session was an invited session by Prof. Alfred Inselberg and he talked about a revolutionary method to represent points in an n-dimensional plane by means of [Parallel Coordinates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_coordinates).

Our presentation was slated for July 17 evening session, and it went off like a charm. The talk was very well received and there were lot of questions regarding the scale of the algorithms, since this was live for today’s txtWeb user base, which is easily more than 11 million! Lots of researchers were impressed with our vision to “Enable anyone with any mobile phone to create, discover and consume bite-sized services through a single global publishing platform”

There were a lot of questions regarding our future work, including whether this service would become available entirely over voice, hence eliminating the end user to even type out a single letter of text and make the service even more accessible. People were also interested to know about our business model and how we plan to take this to the next level.
