If any of you are working weekends or pulling all nighters thinking ‘If I don’t do this, the other guy/company will crush me’, this article is a very good read : <https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/ef4772e3c628>

Kyle Bragger in this article talks about how vacations are important and so are setting clear working hours. As he points out, it gives you more time for liking your work and spending time with family. This would also lead to the most productive days of your life. I have bought this idea and think it’s worth trying out :-)
