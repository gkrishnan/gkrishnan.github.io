This video is the search quality review meeting at Google, yes they publicly released a video of it. This particular “Weekly Review Meeting” was to review spelling correction for long queries. The amount of thought which goes into every single change at Google, the depth of the discussions taking place there and the profiles of the people who were talking just blew me off.

This is a great watch for anyone who has ever wondered how Google Search manages to get it right every single time!
