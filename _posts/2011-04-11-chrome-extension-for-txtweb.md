Hi everyone,

I work on txtWeb, an SMS based platform aiming to get the internet on mobile! You can find all sorts of amazing apps, most of them built by students, which let you check cricket scores, tweet, FB, check PNR status, play games all over SMS!

Supporting the true sense of accessibility, I had gone ahead and published a Chrome extension for txtWeb, for those who want  a flavour of txtWeb, even without logging into the txtWeb website ! Enjoy the power of  txtWeb on your Chrome ;).

Hereâ€™s the link to it on the Chrome Webstore: <http://goo.gl/ceXXF>
